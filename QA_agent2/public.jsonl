Many of the other institutions share that generosity of spirit, with the zoo and history museum also having free admission, and even the Muny keeping a section of free seats on a first-come, first-served basis.", "country": "United States", "city": "St. Louis", "info": {"reference": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forest_Park_(St._Louis)", "hints": "1904 Worlds Fair, Forest Park, the Muny, the world-famous Zoo"}}
